This repository is an implementation of a particle system using JavaScript and D3.js.  The main logic is contained in particles.js.  Many of the functions in the system can be repurposed and passed different arguments to change the system's initial conditions and simulate other physical phenomena.  The default simulation here is an example of magnetic confinement of positively charged particles.  

If you would like to experiment with the repo locally, just clone it to you computer and open the index.html file in the browser.
